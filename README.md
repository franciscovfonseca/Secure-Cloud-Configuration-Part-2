<br>

In this Lab we‚Äôre going to Implement **NIST 800-53 Control SC-7 - Boundary Protection**.

In the previous Lab we looked through the different **Security Recommendations**, **Regulatory Compliance** & **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

We have already analyzed a few **Vulnerabilities in our Cloud Environment and Resources**.

So the next step is to work on Implementing this **Security Control**:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a368d43c-06b0-40d9-a4ec-6ccb7eb1a8ea)

<br>

So in this part of our Project we‚Äôre going to:

-	Configure a **Network Security Group** on our **Subnet**.
  
-	Implement **Private Link & Private Endpoints** on our **Storage Account & Key Vault**.
  
-	Enable the Built-In **Firewall** on our **Storage Account & Key Vault**.

**<summary> üí° Refresher</summary>**

<br>

To give you an idea of how our Environment has evolved over the Previous Labs:

‚û°Ô∏è Originally we had our Virtual Machines, Storage Account & Key Vault deployed and Exposed to the Public Internet in an Insecure Way.

‚û°Ô∏è We added NSGs to our VMs ‚ûú but they were configured to be wide-open on purpose so bad actors would find them.

<br>

So this was our **Initial Configuration**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cee5fb8-aa04-4d5b-af31-56440194db9b)

<br>

When we were working our Incidents ‚ûú there were a lot of Brute-Force Events.

To mitigate those instances and go through the Incident Management Lifecycle ‚ûú we ended up **Hardening our NSG**s.

We configured the NSGs to only allow Inbound Traffic from our own Personal Computer:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8522ad3-e296-4885-96ad-384560f79ec6)

<br>

Our Storage Account & Key Vault are still Exposed to the Public Internet though.

<br>

So what we‚Äôre going to do in this Lab is:

<br>

‚ù∂ Apply another **NSG** to our Subnet ‚ûú since the Security Control is requesting it.

<br>

‚ù∑ Enable **Private Endpoint** for our Storage Account & our Key Vault


- What that does is take them off the Public Internet and makes them accessible only within our Subnet and Virtual Network

- So theoretically only the VMs that are in the Subnet and VNet are going to be able to access those 2 Resources.

<br>

‚ù∏ And we‚Äôre also going to Enable the Built-in **Firewall** on these 2 Resources as well to disallow access from the Public Internet.

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

So at the end of this Lab our Environment will look something like this:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c53301c2-058d-43db-a543-8001ce0f4bf7)

<br>

Most of the following Vulnerabilities (except for the Azure Firewall on the VNet) should be Remediated:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

And then we‚Äôre going to wait another 24 hours and take a Snapshot of our Stats in the Maps.

We'll then compare those new stats with the previous Security Metrics from the when our Environment was Insecure.

The first thing we‚Äôre going to do is Enable the Firewall and Configure Azure Private Link for our Key vault instance.

Inside the Azure Portal ‚ûú click on our ```akv-cyber-lab``` Key Vault instance:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

We‚Äôll first **Enable the Firewall** ‚ûú so click on the **Networking** blade:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

Under the **Firewalls and virtual networks** tab we‚Äôll:

> ‚óâ **Disable public access**
> 
> ‚òë **Allow trusted Microsoft services to bypass this firewall**

Click the **Apply** button:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

‚úÖ Our Key Vault has now the Firewall Enabled

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

Next we‚Äôre going to Configure the Private Endpoint for our Key Vault.

<br>

  <details close> 
  
**<summary> üí°</summary>**

This will take it from being totally exposed to the Public Internet ‚ûú to only being accessible through our Virtual Network and Subnet.

  </details>

<br>

Still inside Networking ‚ûú this time under the **Private endpoint connections** tab ‚ûú click on ‚ûï **Create**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

Under the ‚ù∂ **Basics** tab:
-	Select our ```RG-Cyber-Lab``` **Resource group**
-	We‚Äôll **Name** it ```PE-AKV```
-	Select the same **Region** that we‚Äôve been using ‚ûú ```East US 2```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

Now under the ‚ù∑ **Resources** tab we‚Äôll set up:
-	**Connection method**‚ûú ‚óâ ```Connect to an Azure resource in my directory``` 
-	**Resource type** ‚ûú search for and select ```Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults```

<br>

First we‚Äôll click on the **Configuration** blade.

For **Allow Blob public access** ‚ûú we‚Äôll select ‚óâ ```Disabled```

‚ö†Ô∏è We have to do this in order to satisfy the **NIST 800-53 SC-7** Requirement.

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

The next step is to Add a Private Endpoint for our ```sacyberlab01``` Storage Account instance.

We‚Äôll go to the **Private endpoint connections** tab ‚ûú and click on ‚ûï **Private endpoint**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

Inside the **Azure Portal** ‚ûú we'll go to **Network Watcher**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

Click on the **Topology** Blade ‚ûú and this is our **Topology Page**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

It shows a Network Diagram of what our Azure Resources look like in our Subscription.

Basically we need to "Filter the Topology" to show the correct Resources ‚ûú so we'll click on the **Scope** section:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

We'll select:
- Our **Subscription** ‚ûú ```Azure Subscription 1```
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only the **Resource Group** ```RG-Cyber-Lab``` ‚ûú because that's essentially where all our Resources are.
- Our Environment's Resources' **Location** ‚ûú ```East US 2```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

<h2></h2>

We'll now observe if the Key Vault and Storage Account Private Endpoints are shown in our Network Topology Diagram.

If we click the ‚ûï on the Private Endpoint for our Azure Key Vault:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

‚úÖ We can see that it is associated with the Subnet which is attached to our Key Vault instance ```akv-cyber-lab-9999```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

  </details>

<details close> 
<summary> <h2>3Ô∏è‚É£ Check the IP addresses of our Key Vault & Storage Account inside our Windows VM</h2> </summary>
<br>

The next thing we're going to do is login to our **Windows VM** and make sure **Private Endpoint** is working.

So inside the **Azure Portal** ‚ûú we'll go our ```windows-vm``` ‚ûú and copy its **Public IP Address**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

We'll open up Microsoft Remote Desktop ‚ûú and then attempt to connect to the ```windows-vm```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

Once we've RDP connected into our Windows VM ‚ûú we'll open **Powershell**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

The next step is to check the **Private IP Addresses** of our Key Vault and Storage Account instances by using ```nslookup```

üìù This is how we resolve FQDN or the name of any host to IP Addresses.

So we'll go back to the **Azure Portal** ‚ûú inside our Key Vault ```akv-cyber-lab``` ‚ûú and copy its **FQDN**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

We'll go back to the Windows VM ‚ûú in **Powershell** type in ```nslookup``` and paste the Key Vault's **FQDN** ‚ûú press Enter:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

It resolves to ```10.0.0.5```

This means our **Private Endpoint** is working and our Key Vault is actually **within the same VNET / Subnet as our Windows VM** (our at least it is accessible from there).

‚úÖ So we have confirmed that Key Vault is set up correctly with Private Endpoint.

<br>

  <details close> 
  
**<summary> üí° Reminder</summary>**

I can see Private Endpoint is working, not because it's resolving to exactly ```10.0.0.5``` ‚ûú but because it's resolving to a **Private IP Address** within our **Subnet's range**.

If I was resolving to a **Public IP Address** ‚ûú then we'd have to troubleshoot.

  </details>

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

We'll check our Storage Account's Private Endpoint next.

Back in the **Azure Portal** ‚ûú we'll go to our Storage Acount ```sacyberlab01```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

Scroll down and click on the **Endpoints** blade ‚ûú copy the **Blob Service FQDN** (the full name of our Storage Account):

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

We'll go back to our Windows VM ‚ûú type in ```nslookup``` and paste the Storage Account's **FQDN** ‚ûú press Enter:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

We get this ```10.0.0.7``` Private IP Address.

‚úÖ So we can confirm that the Private Endpoint for our Storage Account is set up correctly as well

<h1>Summary</h1>
<br>

We have completed this lab ‚úÖ

Most of the Requirements for **NIST 800-53 SC-7** & Recommendations in **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** were satisfied:

- We configured a **Network Security Group** on our Subnet

- Implemented **Private Endpoints** on our **Storage Account & Key Vault**.
  
-	And enabled the **Firewall** on our **Storage Account & Key Vault**.

<br>

In the next Lab we're going to Capture our Stats after waiting another 24 hours ‚ûú now that our Environment has been Hardened and Secured.

We'll then compare that Data with the Events we had before.
