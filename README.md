<br>

In this Lab we‚Äôre going to Implement **NIST 800-53 Control SC-7 - Boundary Protection**.

In the previous Lab we looked through the different **Security Recommendations**, **Regulatory Compliance** & **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

We have already analyzed a few **Vulnerabilities in our Cloud Environment and Resources**.

So the next step is to work on Implementing this **Security Control**:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a368d43c-06b0-40d9-a4ec-6ccb7eb1a8ea)

<br>

In this Lab we‚Äôre going to:

-	Configure a Network Security Group on our Subnet.
  
-	Implement Private Link & Private Endpoints on our Storage Account & Key Vault.
  
-	Enable the Built-In Firewall on our Storage Account & Key Vault.

**<summary> üí° Refresher</summary>**

<br>

To give you an idea of how our Environment has evolved over the Previous Labs:

‚û°Ô∏è Originally we had our Virtual Machines, Storage Account & Key Vault deployed and exposed to the Public Internet in an Insecure Way.

‚û°Ô∏è We added NSGs to our VMs ‚ûú but they were configured to be wide-open on purpose so bad actors would find them.

<br>

So this was our Initial Configuration:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cee5fb8-aa04-4d5b-af31-56440194db9b)

<br>

When we were working our Incidents ‚ûú there were a lot of Brute-Force Events.

To mitigate those instances and go through the Incident Management Lifecycle ‚ûú we ended up Hardening our NSGs.

We configured the NSGs to only allow Inbound Traffic from our own Personal Computer:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8522ad3-e296-4885-96ad-384560f79ec6)

<br>

Our Storage Account & Key Vault are still exposed to the Public Internet though.

<br>

So what we‚Äôre going to do in this Lab is:

<br>

‚ù∂ Apply another NSG to our Subnet ‚ûú since the Security Control is requesting it.

<br>

‚ù∑ Enable Private Endpoint for our Storage Account & our Key Vault


- What that does is take them off the Public Internet and makes them accessible only within our Subnet and Virtual Network

- So theoretically only the VMs that are in the Subnet and VNet are going to be able to access those 2 Resources.

<br>

‚ù∏ And we‚Äôre also going to Enable the Built-in Firewall on these 2 Resources as well to disallow access from the Public Internet.

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

So at the end of this Lab our Environment will look something like this:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c53301c2-058d-43db-a543-8001ce0f4bf7)

<br>

Most of the following Vulnerabilities (except for the Azure Firewall on the VNet) should be Remediated:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

And then we‚Äôre going to wait another 24 hours and take a Snapshot of our Stats in the Maps.

We'll then compare those new stats with the previous Security Metrics from the when our Environment was Insecure.

<summary> <h2>1Ô∏è‚É£ Configure the Firewall & Azure Private Link for our Azure Key Vault</h2> </summary>
<br>

The first thing we‚Äôre going to do is Enable the Firewall and Configure Azure Private Link for our Key vault instance.

Inside the Azure Portal ‚ûú click on our ```akv-cyber-lab``` Key Vault instance:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

We‚Äôll first enable the Firewall ‚ûú so click on the **Networking** blade:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

Under the **Firewalls and virtual networks** tab we‚Äôll:

> ‚óâ **Disable public access**
> 
> ‚òë **Allow trusted Microsoft services to bypass this firewall**

Click the **Apply** button:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

‚úÖ Our Key Vault has now the Firewall Enabled

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

Next we‚Äôre going to Configure the Private Endpoint for our Key Vault.

<br>

  <details close> 
  
**<summary> üí°</summary>**

This will take it from being totally exposed to the Public Internet ‚ûú to only being accessible through our Virtual Network and Subnet.

  </details>

<br>

Still inside Networking ‚ûú this time under the **Private endpoint connections** tab ‚ûú click on ‚ûï **Create**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

Under the ‚ù∂ **Basics** tab:
-	Select our ```RG-Cyber-Lab``` **Resource group**
-	We‚Äôll **Name** it ```PE-AKV```
-	Select the same **Region** that we‚Äôve been using ‚ûú ```East US 2```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

Now under the ‚ù∑ **Resources** tab we‚Äôll set up:
-	**Connection method**‚ûú ‚óâ ```Connect to an Azure resource in my directory``` 
-	**Resource type** ‚ûú search for and select ```Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults```
-	**Resource** ‚ûú pick the name of your Key Vault instance: ```akv-cyber-lab```
-	**Target sub-resource** ‚ûú lab ```vault```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

Under the ‚ù∏ **Virtual Network** tab:
-	**Virtual Network**‚ûú pick our VNet ```Lab-Vnet (RG-Cyber-Lab)``` where we‚Äôre having everything connect to
-	**Subnet** ‚ûú select our ```default``` Subnet
-	**Private IP configuration**‚ûú ‚óâ ```Dynamically allocate IP address```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

For the ‚ùπ **DNS** tab:
-	**Integrate with private DNS zone**‚ûú ‚óâ ```Yes```

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure the **Subscription** & **Resource Group** are correct.

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a74fb8f-ed49-4806-a3e0-507a3f2cafb1)

<br>

‚úÖ We‚Äôll then just **Review + create** to finish creating the Key Vault‚Äôs Private Endpoint.

<br>

The next thing we‚Äôre going to do is **Enable Regulatory Compliance for NIST 800-53**.

This will basically do the same thing as the **MDC Secure Score Recommendations** ‚ûú but it‚Äôll do it in the ‚Äúlens‚Äù of **NIST 800-53**.

<br>

**<summary> üìå Refresher</summary>**

<br>

[NIST 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home) is a really large control catalog with a lot of different control families like:

-	 Access Control
-	 Identification and Authentication
-	 Incidence Response, etc.

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1cce53-082a-4c9e-b6d5-7da25a14a9d7)

<br>

These are all different categories ‚ûú and then inside of these there‚Äôs a lot of **Sub-Controls** essentially

For example: inside of **"SC - SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATION PROTECTION"** ‚ûú there's a lot of different Categories:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1cce53-082a-4c9e-b6d5-7da25a14a9d7)

<br>

When we enable NIST 800-53 Regulatory Compliance inside of Defender for Cloud:

  - It‚Äôs basically going to look at all the different Controls inside of NIST 800-53
    
  - And it'll suggest different things we can do in our Environment that align with, for example, SC-7:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1cce53-082a-4c9e-b6d5-7da25a14a9d7)

<br>

Essentially it will suggest different implementations we can do in Azure to bring our Environment "Up to Par" with NIST 800-53.

In a way, show us Gaps in relation to Controls that exist in NIST 800-53.

  </details>

<br>

To add NIST 800-53:

  - First inside the MDC home page ‚ûú click on the **Regulatory Compliance** blade on the left side:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1cce53-082a-4c9e-b6d5-7da25a14a9d7)

<br>

  - Then at the top ‚ûú click on **Manage compliance policies**:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1cce53-082a-4c9e-b6d5-7da25a14a9d7)

<br>

  - We'll then click on our ```Azure subscription 1```:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1cce53-082a-4c9e-b6d5-7da25a14a9d7)

<br>

  - Inside the **Security policy** blade ‚ûú under **Industry & regulatory standards**  ‚ûú click on the **"Add more standards"** button:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1cce53-082a-4c9e-b6d5-7da25a14a9d7)

<br>

  - Add ```NIST 800-53 R5``` as a **Regulatory Compliance Standard**:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1cce53-082a-4c9e-b6d5-7da25a14a9d7)

<br>

- We'll leave the Configuration Settings for the Initiative Assignment as the Default ones ‚ûú and click **"Create"**

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1cce53-082a-4c9e-b6d5-7da25a14a9d7)

<br>

The Policy Initiative Assignment takes a few minutes to take effect.

After waiting a while ‚ûú we can confirm that **NIST 800-53 R5** was successfully assigned to our Subscription ‚úÖ

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1cce53-082a-4c9e-b6d5-7da25a14a9d7)

<br>


‚ö†Ô∏è Again ‚ûú it takes some time for the policy to be added to our Environment.

But eventually it should appear inside of our MDC Dashboard ‚ûú under **Regulatory compliance**:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1cce53-082a-4c9e-b6d5-7da25a14a9d7)

  <details close> 
  
**<summary> üìù Context</summary>**

Basically NIST 800-53 contains a whole bunch of control families with different Controls that you can apply to your Environment.

NIST 800-53 is not specific to any Environment ‚ûú they're just generalized Controls.

But Microsoft created this NIST 800-53 Policy to map those General Controls to things that we can actually do inside of Azure.

This are the general Control Families defined by NIST:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1cce53-082a-4c9e-b6d5-7da25a14a9d7)

<br>

If we expand one of the Control Families ‚ûú **‚ÄúAC. Access Control‚Äù** for example:

It shows what we can do inside of the Azure Portal to our Resources to be ‚ÄúCompliant‚Äù with each individual Sub-Control:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1cce53-082a-4c9e-b6d5-7da25a14a9d7)

<br>

Again as an example: for **IR-6(2)** as defined by NIST ‚ûú there could be some improvements made in our Environment:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1cce53-082a-4c9e-b6d5-7da25a14a9d7)

<br>

We can click on the first **Automated assessment** ‚ûú and MDC will give us Instructions on how to remediate this issue:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1cce53-082a-4c9e-b6d5-7da25a14a9d7)

<br>

If we expand the ```‚à® Remediation steps``` ‚ûú it'll give us the Steps to Take in order to Manually Remidiate this Sub-Control.

  </details>



‚û°Ô∏è In our upcoming lab ‚ûú we're going to implement **SC-7 Boundary Protection**, in order to bring this Control "Up to Compliance".

<h1>Summary</h1>
<br>

To recap:

In this lab we Enabled NIST 800-53 Regulatory Compliance Policy.

Basically when we did that ‚ûú Azure looked at our entire Environment and compared it to NIST 800-53 General Control Families:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1cce53-082a-4c9e-b6d5-7da25a14a9d7)

<br>

In doing so, it essentially found all the weak spots in our Environment that could be addressed by the **NIST 800-53 Control Catalog**.

And in the next lab we'll start remediating a few of these **Compliance Controls**.
